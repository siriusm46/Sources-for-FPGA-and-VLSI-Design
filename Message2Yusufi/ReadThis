Hello Yutufi! 

Here is how I recommend you to move with this river of sources! 
Ready to listen your big sister!?
I am starting! 


For the first step, you must to learn about the LOGIC CIRCUTRY DESIGN as basics! 
1. Decimal-Binary-Hexadecimal number systems and how to convert them to each other?
2. How the standard gates work? 
3. What is the Karnaugh's Map and Canonical Forms?  
4. How is a Adder+Counter+FlipFlop works? 
5. Whats Finite State Machine?

I recommend your own native lang and its TURKISH! Go for the Mehmet Burak Aykenar's Youtube channel quickly! And try to finish the lessons as much as possible! 

But lets think that you already got the basics course and you dont wanna lose your precious lazy time over some superb duperb very easy to understand courses and handle everything and cry day and night for very easy problems ALL BY YOURSELF! 
Then you can basically jump to the Verilog or VHDL or SystemVerilog courses I recommended. I can not say one is better than other. but i recommend you to get the basics in your own native language so it can be a good foundation for improvement in the future. 
You still can learn from other sources of other languages but your factory settings are the best to learn for the first step! And Dear Prof. OÄŸuz Ergin hoca EFSANE PERFECT! 
If you finish his lessons too... Now you got the very best foundation on this topic. While learning Verilog you can practice on your cutey FPGA! 
For the further knowledge i put all the sources together as much as i can. I hope you enjoy while learning 
And i hope i did not hype you too much about my preparetions on this repo. I am the queen's of the procrastinators unfortunately. Please forgive me. 


If anyone other than Yutufi is reading this, 
HEELOOOO! 
I am Hiji Hiji and i am almost self-taught, and need to learn more and moaaaarrrr! I hope you can find something new for yourself in here and enjoy! It's nothing much tho!
